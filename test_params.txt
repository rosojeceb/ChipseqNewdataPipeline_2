path_annotation: 
Example: /home/user/experiment/annotation/chromosome.gtf 
PLEASE make sure the genome is in GTF format. If it isn't, you can unzip it by using the unzip command.

Where are the chip samples located?
path_chip_sample_1: 
Example: /home/user/experiment/samples/chip/chip_1.fq.gz

Where are the input samples located?
path_input_sample_1: 
Example: /home/user/experiment/samples/input/input_1.fq.gz

What is the average length of the promoters (pb) in your organism?
promoter_length: 
Example: 1000
